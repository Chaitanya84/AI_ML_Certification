What are libraries? 

Libraries are collection of prebuilt python function which enable coder to use the function for enahncing their code. Idea behind this is coder should focus on implementing their application rather than spending time in testing and optimising these their own implementation. This not only reduces development time but also avaoid creating new bugs in the application.
