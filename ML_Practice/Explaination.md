## simple synthetic dataset for you that mimics a linear relationship between a single feature (X) and a target variable (y).

#### ğŸ“Œ Problem Setup

Letâ€™s assume a basic linear equation:

### y=3x+7+noise

Where:

x is a feature (independent variable),

y is the target (dependent variable),

noise adds randomness to simulate real-world data.

#### ğŸ“¦ Whats Contained in the folder

**_train.csv_** : 100 data points

**_test.csv_** : 20 data points (same structure, unseen data)
